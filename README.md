# Assignment 5 – Data Structures and Strings in Python  

This repository contains two Python programs:  

- **task1.py** → Creates a dictionary of student names and marks, allows user input to search, and displays marks or an error message if the student is not found.  
- **task2.py** → Demonstrates list slicing by extracting the first five numbers from a list of 1–10, reversing them, and displaying both lists.  

## How to Run  
Run the scripts using:  
```bash
python task1.py
python task2.py
